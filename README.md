Analysis:
The accuracy score tells us how well our model is performing. A higher accuracy score means our model is making more correct predictions. By changing the number of components in LDA or PCA, we can see how the model's performance changes as we reduce the dimensionality of the data.

Comparison with PCA:
When using PCA, we observed how the model's performance changed with different levels of dimensionality reduction. This helps us understand the trade-offs between dimensionality reduction and model accuracy.

Comparison with LDA:
Similarly, when using LDA, we observed how the model's performance changed with different numbers of components. This allows us to compare the effectiveness of LDA and PCA in improving the model's accuracy.

Key Features:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Includes data loading, handling missing values, and data scaling.

LDA Implementation: Implements LDA using scikit-learn library to find the optimal linear discriminants.

Dimensionality Reduction: Reduces the dimensionality of the dataset while maximizing class separability.

Classification: Trains a classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM) on the reduced data and evaluates its performance.
